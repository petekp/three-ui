# three-ui

An experimental, futuristic UI component library made of **real materials, real physics, and real depth** — three.js/WebGL underneath, shadcn-like ergonomics on top (eventually).

## lab 001 — feasibility

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To test the HTML-in-canvas path, run Chrome 148–150 with the flag enabled
(`chrome://flags/#canvas-draw-element`, or launch with
`--enable-features=CanvasDrawElement`). Without it the form panel falls back
to drei's `<Html transform>` (CSS3D overlay).

### Specimens

| Specimen | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `<PhysicalButton />` | Components as physical objects — a cap that actually travels, spring-tuned press/release, emissive state |
| `<GlassCard />` | Real materials — a transmissive glass slab refracting its own content plate |
| `<HtmlPanel />` | **Live DOM as a texture** via the HTML-in-canvas origin trial, with CSS3D fallback |
| `<ChipDispenser />` | UI governed by a physics engine (Rapier) — elements that fall, bounce, pile |

### HTML-in-canvas findings (Chrome 150, empirical)

The origin trial works, but the real contract is stricter than the blog post suggests:

1. **Element placement**: the source element must be a *child of the canvas you draw into*, and that canvas needs `canvas.layoutSubtree = true` (also settable as a `layoutsubtree` attribute) so the child participates in layout.
2. **Paint lifecycle**: `ctx.drawElementImage(el, x, y)` only succeeds inside the canvas's `onpaint` callback, scheduled with `canvas.requestPaint()`. Called anywhere else you get `"No cached paint record for element"`.
3. **Deferred rasterization**: the draw is recorded, not executed — pixels land at paint time. Readback (`getImageData`, `drawImage`, texture upload) sees them one frame later. For a render loop this just means one frame of latency.
4. **Visibility requirement**: the source canvas must be in-document **and on-screen** to receive paint records. `left: -10000px` parking silently produces a blank canvas. Parking it at `z-index: -1` behind the app works.
5. **No readback restriction** (same-origin): after paint, `getImageData` returns real pixels, so a plain `THREE.CanvasTexture` over a 2D canvas works — no need to touch `texElementImage2D` for the naive path.
6. **Full API surface** on `HTMLCanvasElement`: `layoutSubtree`, `onpaint`, `requestPaint()`, `captureElementImage()`, `getElementTransform()`; plus `CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawElementImage` and `WebGL2RenderingContext.texElementImage2D`.

Verified live: a ticking clock inside the DOM subtree shows up in the 3D texture in real time.

## lab 002 — the primitive set

Thesis shift: three-ui is not a component kit, it's the bridge that makes DOM
available as *matter*. Three primitives, all verified working:

### `<Surface>` (`src/primitives/Surface.tsx`)
Live DOM as the skin of **any geometry**, with input forwarded back:
r3f raycast → intersection UV → element coordinates → synthetic pointer
events on the real subtree (`src/primitives/forwardEvents.ts`).

Verified on a concave cylinder ("helm console"): clicking a field through
the curved surface focuses the real `<input>`; **native keyboard then types
into it with zero key-forwarding code** (we only stop the canvas stealing
focus — see `KeepDomFocus` in `App.tsx`). `:hover`/`:focus` styles, CSS
validation states, checkboxes and selects all round-trip. The a11y tree
stays intact — automation sees a real textbox/combobox/checkbox on the
cylinder.

Gotchas discovered:
- Native `<select>` dropdowns can't be opened by synthetic clicks — we cycle
  the value instead; a real library renders its own popover surface.
- Concave geometry: render `THREE.DoubleSide` (NOT `BackSide` — normals
  aren't flipped for BackSide, so lights can't hit the inner face) and set
  `mirrorU` to un-mirror the texture.
- Spotlight targets must be added to the scene graph or they aim at origin.

### `<MomentumCard>` (`src/primitives/MomentumCard.tsx`)
Motion as forces, not tweens: mass + spring joint + your gesture velocity.
Drag makes the body kinematic (velocity integrated from the pointer),
release hands the smoothed velocity to Rapier. No durations, no easing —
interruption mid-flight is just another grab.

### focus-as-light (`src/scenes/Lab002.tsx`)
Scene lighting bound to DOM state: `focusin`/`focusout` on the live subtree
drives a key spotlight (2 → 320 candela, damped); failed validation pulses a
red point light from inside the console. Attention is literal light, not a
token.

### Environment note
Chrome throttles rAF to 1fps for occluded windows (e.g. display asleep) —
looks exactly like a code hang. Launch test browsers with
`--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows --disable-renderer-backgrounding`.

### Open questions (lab 003+)
- Popover surfaces: replace native select dropdowns with Surface-rendered popovers.
- `texElementImage2D` + `THREE.ExternalTexture`: skip the 2D-canvas middleman.
- DOM on deforming geometry: cloth, paper folds, sphere sections.
- Multiple Surfaces at once (hidden source canvases must not occlude each other's paint).
- Focus light that *aims* at the focused field (UV → cylinder point inversion).
